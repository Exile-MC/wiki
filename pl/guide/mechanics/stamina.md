# Stamina
Stamina is a point system that limits how many major actions a player may take in a 24 hour period. PLayers have a limited number of stamina, which regenerate every 24 hours from their use(may change how they regenerate). Major actions like forming territories, learning skills, crafting certain machines, enacting government edicts, etc all require you to spend a stamina point.
