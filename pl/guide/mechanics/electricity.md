# Electric Power
Electricity is an important component of running processing, defenses, and more within your terreitories.


Un sorted notes
- Virtual wires, run calculations only once every 20 ticks, but do it at 20x, and display everything to the player as if it were per tick.
- Dont register wires, let the wires determine the order in which producers and consumers operate, and then just run through the list in order for each connected system. way more efficient, way less garbage generated
