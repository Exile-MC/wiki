# Unsorted Notes

## Core Idea
Focus on geopolitical roleplay centered around practical skills and mechanics that can be semi unique and valuable to those who dont have it to the point that inter nation commerce can occur.

Skill trees with limited number of points available at all times. Eachtree applies a specific type of buff or boon, or unlocks special equipment higher up the tree. Unique combinations of trees result in unique capabilities among player base. Other entities looking to implement the more advanced skills would eithr have to train a dedicated player, which is reasonable for larger entities, or hire people from outside their territory to do it for them. 



Pearling, Any player can pearl, if you arent authorized by a territory to do so, then it mainly prevents you from coming within a small radius of that individual and only for a very short time. If done by someone authorized to do so within the territory


High council votes should result in actionable mechanic aligned results, instead of just outright granting them admin capabilities.
Example, incredibly malicious actors could be excommunicated, resulting in in game debuffs, and maybe, revealing their log out location for faster pearl. 





Things to drop

Gold

Silver

Cinnabar Becomes mercury with low temp smelting

casseterite becomes tin with high temp carbon, and then leached with water to remove impurities (makes slag)

sulfide ore must be crushed then mix with water to make sulfide slurry, which is then made molten, resulting in sulfur to bind to the oxygen in the water of the slurry to make sulur oxide, and the left over metals is mostly copper, with a little bit of iron, gold and silver. Can be further refined with electrolisis which makes more gold and silver, and pure copper. Silica is required in one of the processes which binds with impurities, diorite is mostly silica.

Ironstone becomes pig iron, can be refined into iron, and then refined into steel. Limestone removes impurities during one ofd these processes for iron, use sandstone, it is high sand percent limestone.
