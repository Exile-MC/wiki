# Unsorted Notes

## Core Idea
Focus on geopolitical roleplay centered around practical skills and mechanics that can be semi unique and valuable to those who dont have it to the point that intr nation commerce can occur.

Skill trees with limited number of points available at all times. Eachtree applies a specific type of buff or boon, or unlocks special equipment higher up the tree. Unique combinations of trees result in unique capabilities among player base. Other entities looking to implement the more advanced skills would eithr have to train a dedicated player, which is reasonable for larger entities, or hire people from outside their territory to do it for them.
