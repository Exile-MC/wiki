# Village Goverment Types
A Democratic village will be the most challenging for most players, focused on growing and sharing wealth and resources among its members with a majority focus on the needs of each individual of the group. It allows for an elected official whos goal is to secure the freedoms of its members. And must reliquish control to a new elected official in cycles, as defined in the charter.

A Totalitarian village will be the most common government type. In it, the goals are basically the same as a democratic village, however the founder of the village maintains supreme authority, and limits the freedoms of the villages members. They may relinquish power, or be overthrown, but do not run elections for a replacement. This is your standard towny experience. A mayor or similarly titled leader takes care of everyone, probably has decent intentions, isnt completely devoted to the geopolitical roleplay, and never intends to not be the owner of their own little domain.

An authoritarian government is militaristic in nature. Controlled by a powerful entity who cannot be easily overthrown, but grants more freedoms to its members then potentially both other main types of villages. This could be for example, a band of raiders with a home base acting as thir village. They play for combat, a simpler objective then distribution of resources, wealth, and freedoms. The ruler is absolute but likely rules with high levels of loyalty, like a big fucked up family. a criminal organization would be another example of an authoritarian government in the context of the exile server.
