# Official Registry
In order to unlock in server functionality for operating a government structure, you must first register your government, this is done by declaring your presence with a formal charter, and having it approved by the admins. We manually verify approve every charter, however we will almost never reject a charter, we only check them to ensure they have everything required to oprate as a government. 

You may form any kind of government with any structure, leadership, laws, and rights you wish. However we do provide some templates for common types of governments players may wish to form. Simply copy the template, modify it to your liking, fill in your information, and submit it.
