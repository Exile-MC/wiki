# FortiChunk
FortiChunk's classic civ equivalent is called "Bastion". The core concept was spending additional resources to fortify a block, requiring it to be broken an exponential additional number of times to actually break that block. However maintaining fortifcations was tedious because it was based on each block. Fortichunk instead creates the [Bastion](https://wiki.exile.rocks/en/guide/compendium#bastion) block, which when placed within a claimed chunk, fortifies every block in a 16x16x16 region. This fortified region always lines up with the chunk the bastion sits in.



Unsorted Notes
- Handful of protection tiers, which cost exponentially more resources to exponentially increase the number fo times a block must be broken to actually break it.
- In order to enhance a bastion so it fortifies the entire chunk column, you have to spend a nether star on each bastion.
- Making it chunk based, and allowing enhanced bastions to be anywhere in the column, allows for more focus to be placed on defensive structures, blocks, etc, and makes electrical grids to power these defenses a requirement. Resulting in upkeep requirements without an automatic decay system, which also allows conquring territories to continue to maintain the previous defenses, as is more realistic.
- This also results in more aesthetic and varied defense configurations, rather then EVERY nation just surrounding their vaults with giant gaping holes to bedrock.
