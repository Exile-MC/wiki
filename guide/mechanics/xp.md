Experience is rewarded for a variety of different actions, including the vanilla sources like killing mobs, mining certain ores, etc. However the game adds additional sources, as well as experience gain multipliers.

Exile removes exp levels, and instead allows the player to purchase experience cells for every 1000 experience obtained. Where normally experience levels are indicated, on an exponential scale, the number instead represents how many cells the player could purchase with their current experience. It's important to note that throwing a bottle of enchanting (throwing a cell acts like throwing a bottle) only drops 193-704 experience, so you lose expereince trying to turn it back into orbs. Cells can be used as an ingredient in various magics, including enchanting like normal.
