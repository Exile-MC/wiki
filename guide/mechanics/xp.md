Experience is rewarded for a variety of different actions, including the vanilla sources like killing mobs, mining certain ores, etc. However the game adds additional sources, as well as experience gain multipliers.

Exile removes exp levels, and instead allows the player to fill storage cells for every 1000 experience obtained. Where normally experience levels are indicated, on an exponential scale, the number instead represents how many cells the player could fill with their current experience. It's important to note that throwing a bottle of enchanting (right clicking a cell full of experience acts like throwing a bottle) only drops 193-704 experience, so you lose experience trying to turn it back into orbs. Storage cells filled with expereince allow experience to be used as an ingredient in various magics, including enchanting like normal. Certain crafting recipes may also require experience. The experience cost will be clearly displayed when you place the required items for the crafting recipe.
