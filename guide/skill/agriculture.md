Farming: Allows players to grow crops, such as wheat, potatoes, and carrots, more efficiently and with higher yields.
Animal Husbandry: Allows players to raise and breed animals, such as cows, pigs, and chickens, more efficiently and with higher yields.
Horticulture: Allows players to grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers, as well as create hybrid plants with unique properties.
Aquaculture: Allows players to farm fish and other aquatic animals in tanks or ponds.




Misc skill unlock ideas:
- Seed Identification (by default grass and other sources drop not a wheat seed, but an unidentified seed, which when grown may or may not grow, and what plant grows is randomly selected and wont usually work because the farming configuration will be wrong for that plant) Reveals what type of seed it is, based on where the seed was picked up (seeds picked up in the same area stack, but not from anywhere else, assign nbt based on the region perhaps) (or just make it pure random and if it is random, then grafting capabilities allow for achieving rarer seed types i guess.)
