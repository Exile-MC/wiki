# Mapping
The map is a very important aspect of the geopolitical. Exile's map is located at https://map.exile.rocks

The map does not update by default automatically. People with a cartography or espionage skill can trigger updates to the global map, revealing whats changed in a small area of the world to the entire server. This protects new and forming nations from raids by more powerful territories, as well as adds additional depth to wartime, requiring additional effort to get up to date information on enemy placement and structures.
