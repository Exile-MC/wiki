# The Compendium
Is a master list of all custom blocks and items in the game, how to obtain or craft them, and what they are used for.

# Blocks
The following is a list of all blocks, sorted categorically, then alphabetically.

## Functional
### Bastion
##### Tabs {.tabset}
###### Description
The Bastion block is a functioonal block that when placed, will fortify the 16 by 16 by 16 block chunk aligned region it sits in. Fortification makes blocks require multiple breaks to actually break and drop or remove the fortified block for non authorized players. It by default protects the 16 blocks above it, starting at the y level it sits on, however that 16 block height can be offset up or down as long as the bastion block sits within the fortified 16 block height.
###### Crafting
Bastions can be crafted in the blah
###### Use
Place them everywhere. For a price


### Bastion (Enhanced)
##### Tabs {.tabset}
###### Description
The enhanced Bastion block fortifies the chunk it sits in like the standard Bastion block, however when enhanced, it fortifies the entire chunk column, instead of just the 16 blocks above it.
