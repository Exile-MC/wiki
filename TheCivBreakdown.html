<h2>Progression</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>The goal of civ was to have meaningful worlds spanning real-life years. The fact that vanilla progression can be completed in a matter of days means it needed to be changed.</p>

<h1>Core Plugins</h1>
<h2>Citadel</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>In a server with no rules against griefing and raiding, gameplay favours the griefer as it takes much more time to create infrastructure than to break it. There also needed to be systems that encouraged people to work together and share infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you had to name just one plugin that represents Civ as a whole, <strong>it would be Citadel.</strong></p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<p>Use of basic materials can empower any block. The numbers are flexible, but what is vital is that the first tier of reinforcements <strong>must</strong> be easily accessible to new players. Otherwise, it is hard for them to get invested into the idea.</p>
<p>You can reinforce blocks onto any group you have the relevant permission for. When broken by players not on the group, the reinforcement is <strong>not returned</strong>, but it is returned when broken by someone with relevant permissions on the group.</p>
<p>If you reinforce special blocks under the ‘acid’ type reinforcement, once they mature, breaking that block breaks all reinforced blocks around it, regardless of group. However, there is no way to mass convert reinforcements. <strong>This is bad</strong>, as it leads to ‘all or nothing wars’, where there is no option to gradually take territory and claim it as your own, and instead the only viable victory is essentially extinction of the other group.</p>
<p>One of the most toxic emergent tactics Citadel enables is ‘obby bombing’, where players grief enemy cities with reinforced obsidian. This led to the <i>Bastion</i> plugin, detailed below. Obby bombing damage can be mitigated through design with long maturation times, accessible acid blocks, and passive effects such as faster breaking while in friendly territory.</p>
<h2>Imprisonment</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bastions</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>After a particularly bad series of obby bombings, the admins came up with area protection blocks that stop enemies placing blocks at the cost of their reinforcement. They can eventually be broken. The permissions for a bastion are <strong>highly configurable</strong>, allowing blacklists and whitelists, and enabling and disabling of many features. Their features have gradually crept, growing to block elytra flight and hostile ender pearl flight by default.</p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<p>Bastions only protect the blocks of the y-level they’re on and the blocks above them. This means that 100% of bastions are placed at bedrock. <strong>There is no way to scout a bastion</strong> field without running into it.</p>
<p>Because bastions were implemented hastily and meta-fied even more hastily, it was impossible to change their design without invalidating hundreds of hours of players’ time and drastically changing the meta that players had become accustomed to, and so <strong>their initially poor design has persisted</strong> through several iterations, because of this reluctance to change them.</p>
