<h1>Key</h1>
<p><strong>Important point</strong></p>
<p><i>Reference to another section</i></p>
<h1>Vanilla Mechanics</h1>
<h2>Progression</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>The goal of civ was to have meaningful worlds spanning real-life years. The fact that vanilla progression can be completed in a matter of days means it needed to be changed.</p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<p>Different iterations have handled this in vastly different ways, some by removing access to certain dimensions unless you grind a way to get to them, others disabling crafting recipes entirely and gating them behind <i>FactoryMod</i>. One thing is very clear between all iterations, however: the <strong>more estranged from vanilla</strong> your progression system is, the <strong>fewer players</strong> you retain. People have grown up with 10 years of being able to hand craft iron pickaxes; if you take this away from them, they are much more likely to quit.</p>
<h2>Mining</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>Xray is a bane of survival servers, and solutions to xray such as <i>Obfuscation</i> often run into performance issues. There are also issues with reverse engineering the world seed to find ore.</p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<p>Ore is instead generated whenever a virgin stone block is broken using the <i>HiddenOre</i> plugin.</p>
<h2>Crafting</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>Crafting not only covers handcrafting and workbenches, but also crafting stations such as furnaces and composters.</p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<p>Recipes are often disabled by appropriate plugins due to balance reasons or to gate certain progression behind other materials.</p>

<h1>Core Plugins</h1>
<h2>Citadel</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>In a server with no rules against griefing and raiding, gameplay favours the griefer as it takes much more time to create infrastructure than to break it. There also needed to be systems that encouraged people to work together and share infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you had to name just one plugin that represents Civ as a whole, <strong>it would be Citadel.</strong></p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<p>Use of basic materials can empower any block. The numbers are flexible, but what is vital is that the first tier of reinforcements <strong>must</strong> be easily accessible to new players. Otherwise, it is hard for them to get invested into the idea.</p>
<p>You can reinforce blocks onto any group you have the relevant permission for. When broken by players not on the group, the reinforcement is <strong>not returned</strong>, but it is returned when broken by someone with relevant permissions on the group.</p>
<p>If you reinforce special blocks under the ‘acid’ type reinforcement, once they mature, breaking that block breaks all reinforced blocks around it, regardless of group. However, there is no way to mass convert reinforcements. <strong>This is bad</strong>, as it leads to ‘all or nothing wars’, where there is no option to gradually take territory and claim it as your own, and instead the only viable victory is essentially extinction of the other group.</p>
<p>One of the most toxic emergent tactics Citadel enables is ‘obby bombing’, where players grief enemy cities with reinforced obsidian. This led to the <i>Bastion</i> plugin, detailed below. Obby bombing damage can be mitigated through design with long maturation times, accessible acid blocks, and passive effects such as faster breaking while in friendly territory.</p>
<h2>Imprisonment</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bastions</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>After a particularly bad series of obby bombings, the admins came up with area protection blocks that stop enemies placing blocks at the cost of their reinforcement. They can eventually be broken. The permissions for a bastion are <strong>highly configurable</strong>, allowing blacklists and whitelists, and enabling and disabling of many features. Their features have gradually crept, growing to block elytra flight and hostile ender pearl flight by default.</p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<p>Bastions only protect the blocks of the y-level they’re on and the blocks above them. This means that 100% of bastions are placed at bedrock. <strong>There is no way to scout a bastion</strong> field without running into it.</p>
<p>Because bastions were implemented hastily and meta-fied even more hastily, it was impossible to change their design without invalidating hundreds of hours of players’ time and drastically changing the meta that players had become accustomed to, and so <strong>their initially poor design has persisted</strong> through several iterations, because of this reluctance to change them.</p>
<h2>Stamina/Energy</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>There was an idea that some mechanics should be hard capped by the number of players in a nation and how active they are.</p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<p>Stamina can be claimed every day after 30 minutes of playing as a physical item. You can build up streaks by claiming stamina for several days in a row to get bonus stamina.</p>
<p>Because stamina never expires and is a physical item, it can be hoarded, which leads to very unfun gameplay where people log in simply to claim and hoard stamina, and those who have played the server longer simply have an advantage due to having had more time in which to hoard stamina.</p>
<h2>ItemExchange</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>A safe way to enable fixed goods trading while offline needed to be implemented to properly facilitate meaningful trade.</p>
<p><u>Implementation, Suggestions and Flaws</u></p>
<h1>Pies in the Sky</h1>
<h2>Contraptions</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>Reduce the need to no-life the game by adding structures that can do menial tasks such as harvest large fields at the cost of stamina.</p>
<p><u>Ideas for Implementation</u></p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Wargoals</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>No healthy way to close out a stagnant war. Also provide an emergent reason to have ‘fair fights’ between nations.</p>
<p><u>Ideas for Implementation</u></p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>SkillUp</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>Provide an incentive to specialise into a skill and a single character</p>
<p><u>Ideas for Implementation</u></p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Influence</h2>
<p><u>The Why</u></p>
<p>Areas that are invested into greatly should protect themselves by emitting their own Bastion-like field, even if they're completely aesthetic builds, to encourage building for the sake of building.</p>
